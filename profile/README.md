# About us
At `AutoFeyn`, we're a small, independent research lab working at the intersection of physics and Machine learning. Our Focus is on developing physics-based machine learning methods-algorithms that combine the predictive power of data with the structure and reliability of physical laws. By embedding principles from physics into data-driven models, we aim to build tools that are not only accurate, but also interpretable, data-efficient, and scientifically grounded.

## What We Do
### Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML)
We design algorithms that respect the laws of physics—like conservation of energy or Newton’s laws—while learning from data. This approach helps models make better predictions, even when data is limited.

### Data-Driven Discovery
We use techniques like symbolic regression and sparse identification to uncover governing equations and hidden relationships directly from experimental or simulated data. In short, we help extract the “rules of the game” from observations.

### Fast & Accurate Scientific Simulations
Traditional simulations can take hours or days. We develop surrogate models—lightweight versions of simulations using neural networks—that replicate complex physical behavior much faster, without sacrificing accuracy.

### Custom Research & Collaboration
We work with universities, startups, and industry to apply our tools to real-world problems in fields like fluid dynamics, materials science, and climate modeling. Every project is tailored to the scientific and computational needs of our collaborators.
