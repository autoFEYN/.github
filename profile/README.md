# About us
At `AutoFeyn`, we're a small, independent research lab working at the intersection of physics and Machine learning. Our Focus is on developing physics-based machine learning methods-algorithms that combine the predictive power of data with the structure and reliability of physical laws.
<br>
By embedding principles from physics into data-driven models, we aim to build tools that are not only accurate, but also interpretable, data-efficient, and scientifically grounded.

# What we Do?
## Physics informed Machine Learning <br>
We design algorithms that respect the laws of physics, like conservation of energy or Newton's law, while learning from data. This approach helps models make better predictions, even when data is limited.
